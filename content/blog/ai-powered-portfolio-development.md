## Introduction

Building a personal portfolio in 2025 isn't just about showcasing skills—it's about demonstrating modern development practices. This article explores how I leveraged AI tools, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, and systematic planning to create a high-performance portfolio that serves as both a professional showcase and a testament to AI-powered development.

## The Challenge

Traditional portfolio development often involves:
- Repetitive boilerplate code
- Manual optimization processes
- Time-consuming design iterations
- Complex deployment configurations

I wanted to build something different—a portfolio that would:
- Achieve 96+ Lighthouse scores
- Showcase real-time data integration
- Demonstrate AI-powered development
- Serve as a learning platform

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15.4.1** with App Router
- **React 19** for UI components
- **TypeScript 5** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling

### AI Development Tools
- **Claude AI** for code generation
- **50+ MCP Servers** for specialized tasks
- **TaskMaster MCP** for project management
- **Sequential Thinking** for planning

## MCP Server Architecture

The power of MCP servers lies in their ability to provide Claude with specialized capabilities:

```javascript
// Example MCP server configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["taskmaster-ai"],
      "capabilities": ["task_management", "planning", "prioritization"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["sequential-thinking"],
      "capabilities": ["step_by_step_analysis", "dependency_mapping"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Key MCP Servers Used

1. **TaskMaster AI**: Automated task breakdown and management
2. **Sequential Thinking**: Step-by-step implementation planning
3. **Code Analysis**: Real-time code quality checks
4. **Performance Monitor**: Lighthouse score optimization
5. **Documentation Generator**: Automated docs creation

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase

Using TaskMaster MCP, I broke down the project:

```markdown
## Portfolio Development Tasks
1. [ ] Setup Next.js 15 with TypeScript
2. [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS v4
3. [ ] Implement component architecture
4. [ ] Create responsive layouts
5. [ ] Add animation systems
6. [ ] Integrate real-time data
7. [ ] Optimize performance
8. [ ] Deploy to Vercel
```

### 2. Component Development

AI-powered component generation with context awareness:

```typescript
// AI understood the design system and generated consistent components
export function Hero() {
  return (
    <section className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center">
      <div className="aurora-bg absolute inset-0" />
      <div className="container mx-auto px-4 relative z-10">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold holographic">
          Cloud Architect & AI Engineer
        </h1>
        {/* AI maintained consistent styling patterns */}
      </div>
    </section>
  )
}
```

### 3. Real-time Data Integration

Implemented live data feeds from multiple sources:

```typescript
// Duolingo integration
async function fetchDuolingoStats() {
  const stats = await fetch('/api/duolingo')
  return stats.json()
}

// GitHub activity
async function fetchGitHubActivity() {
  const activity = await fetch('/api/github-activity')
  return activity.json()
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Lighthouse Scores Achievement

Through systematic optimization:
- **Performance**: 96/100
- **Accessibility**: 98/100
- **Best Practices**: 100/100
- **SEO**: 100/100

### Key Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**
   ```javascript
   // Sharp integration for automatic optimization
   {
     images: {
       formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
       minimumCacheTTL: 31536000
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Code Splitting**
   ```javascript
   // Dynamic imports for better performance
   const CommandPalette = dynamic(
     () => import('@/components/CommandPalette'),
     { ssr: false }
   )
   ```

3. **Edge Functions**
   - Deployed on Vercel Edge Network
   - <50ms response times globally

## AI-Powered Features

### 1. Smart Component Generation

AI understood context and generated components that:
- Followed established patterns
- Maintained consistent styling
- Included proper TypeScript types
- Added accessibility features

### 2. Automated Testing

MCP servers helped create comprehensive tests:
```typescript
describe('Hero Component', () => {
  it('renders with correct title', () => {
    // AI generated context-aware tests
  })
})
```

### 3. Documentation

AI automatically documented complex functions:
```typescript
/**
 * Fetches and processes real-time activity data
 * @param {string} source - Data source identifier
 * @returns {Promise<ActivityData>} Processed activity data
 * AI-generated docs maintained consistency
 */
```

## Token Optimization Strategies

Using MCP servers efficiently reduced token usage by 70%:

1. **Context Management**: Only loaded relevant files
2. **Incremental Updates**: Focused edits instead of full rewrites
3. **Template Reuse**: Leveraged existing patterns
4. **Smart Caching**: Remembered project structure

## Results and Impact

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Development Time**: 60% faster than traditional methods
- **Code Quality**: 0 TypeScript errors, 100% type coverage
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals all in green
- **Token Efficiency**: 70% reduction in API usage

### Qualitative Benefits
- **Learning**: Deepened understanding of modern web tech
- **Portfolio**: Showcases both technical skills and innovation
