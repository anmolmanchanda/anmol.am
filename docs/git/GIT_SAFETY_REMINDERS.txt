🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY REMINDER 🚨🚨🚨

NEVER WORK DIRECTLY ON MAIN BRANCH!

ALWAYS:
1. git checkout -b feature/description
2. Do your work
3. git push origin feature/description  
4. Create PR for review

NEVER:
❌ git checkout main && start coding
❌ git commit directly to main
❌ git push origin main without PR

MISTAKE MADE: 2025-01-19
Working directly on main instead of feature branch

CURRENT SAFEGUARDS:
✅ Pre-commit hook installed
✅ Documentation created
✅ Multiple reminder files
✅ Feature branch workflow enforced

CHECK BRANCH BEFORE WORK:
git branch
(Look for * next to current branch)

IF ON MAIN BY MISTAKE:
git checkout -b feature/emergency-branch
(Continue work on feature branch)

🚨🚨🚨 PROTECT MAIN AT ALL COSTS 🚨🚨🚨
